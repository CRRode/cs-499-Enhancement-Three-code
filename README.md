The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  

I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be made to this project. I showcase skills and abilities in software development by creating quality code that includes readability, maintainability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices and coding standards. Additionally, I demonstrate skills in software architecture by using appropriate design patterns and modularization. Throughout the code, I provide documentation with inline comments and clear descriptions of the overall functionality of each code file in the header. Lastly, I demonstrate skills in performance optimization by using algorithms to boost overall performance. In this enhancement, I improved the artifact by creating a SQL database that stores the code for my shapes. I accomplished this by creating a database called 'ShapeCode' and a table within it called 'Shapes.' The 'Shapes' table includes fields for shape ID, name, data, and rendering data. The shape data is the information needed to be called into the source code, while the shapes render data is the information required in the while loop that renders the shape. This allows for a more collaborative environment because anyone can recreate the shapes that I already made in my code and add them to theirs. The shapes stored in the 'Shapes' table include the sphere, cylinder, plane, cube, and light cube. As more shapes are created, this table can expand with a simple SQL insert command. Below, you can see the sphere code that was queried and inserted into the source code. 

Additionally, I created another database called 'ProgramFiles' on the same server to store the program's files, such as the CPPs and header files, along with the 'glad' files and the 'glew32' DLL file required to run this code. This setup allows for snapshots of the program to be taken, adding a layer of security to the code. In the event that the original program is lost, there will be a database backup available. Furthermore, if anyone wishes to create a new OpenGL program, these databases can be utilized to facilitate the process. The code for the shapes can be easily queried and inserted into the program, saving time and effort in figuring out how to create the shapes from scratch. 

Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, I deepened my understanding of technical concepts and tools related to software development, such as SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. While I was a bit rusty on SQL due to not having used it for some time, this enhancement provided an effective opportunity to sharpen my SQL skills. Initially, it was challenging to get started with creating a new database and tables, given my lack of recent experience with SQL. However, with assistance from online resources, I overcame these challenges and completed the task successfully. 


employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science. 
I achieved this outcome through comprehensive comments, code documentation of changes, and a modular structure that enables any programmer to easily understand and edit the code. I included inline comments to explain enhancements and addressed areas lacking comments. Additionally, I provided an overview of each code file's functionality in the header of each file. Lastly, I reached this outcome by creating a database that assists users in creating similar programs to mine using the code I have already developed. 

Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
I accomplished this outcome through a thorough code review where I discussed the code and the enhancement plan that was implemented. Additionally, I provided comments where the code was enhanced, adhering to best computer science practices, and offered a written narrative of the enhancement. Lastly, the project utilizes DLLs, headers, and other resources developed by others, showcasing my ability to effectively collaborate and work with peer-created code. 

Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  
I achieved this outcome by fulfilling both the enhancement criteria I set for myself and the criteria for the entire project. I demonstrated my skills in SQL by creating two separate SQL databases using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to meet the goals of this enhancement. Furthermore, I adhered to the best computer science practices throughout the project and enhancement process. Additionally, I showcased my proficiency in utilizing the OpenGL API, Visual Studio IDE, and the C++ coding language. 

Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. 
I achieved this outcome by securing the databases with a password accessible only to authorized users, including myself and those granted permission. Storing the code in a database provides an additional layer of protection against scenarios where the program is lost or deleted from the computer.
